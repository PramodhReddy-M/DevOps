Who this repository is for?
This repo is for anyone who wants to start implementing DevOps practices. No specific knowledge of development or system operations is required.

The repo aims to guide you through the step-by-step implementation of DevOps practices using different tools that are mostly open source or are leaders in the market.
My goal is to share my daily experience with you; I hope that it will be useful for you and be applied to your projects.
